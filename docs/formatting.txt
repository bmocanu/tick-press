!! This is not Tick formatting, these docs will probably be organized as Markdown !!

Tick files
----------
Tick files are simply text files, with a .txt extension. The files are all the same,
there is no special file to introduce meta content, definitions or other cross-content
material. The users can name their files and organize their content and their definitions
however they feel like. 

E.g.:
A blog owner can organize their content in the following way:
- links.txt: contains all the external links used in the blog posts
- quotes.txt: contains all the quotes defined in one place, and included whenever they are needed
- post-about-cats.txt: a nice post about cats
- post-about-dogs.txt: a nice post about dogs
- about-me.txt: a bio page of the author
- images (folder): contains the images used in the posts

Commands
--------
The formatting in Tick is organized as commands. A command is entered by a tick mark,
has a name and zero or more parameters. Commands have a text body that follows after 
the command is introduced and ends with an empty command (double ticks) or when a new 
command is introduced.

Command format:
<tick><command name> [<command parameters>]<tick>
<command text body>
<tick><tick>

Examples:
`b`This is bold`` and this is normal.
`i`This is italic`` and this is normal again.
Here follows a link to the `link https://google.com`Google`` website.
After all this lovely paragraph, here is a quote that I love:
`h1` This is a heading level 1``
`h1-` This is a heading level 1 that spans the entire line and does not need a finish command

`quote-ref lincoln-folks-happy-minds`

Comments
--------
Comments in Tick are introduced using a command made of two or more dashes. This
helps with easily spotting the comments, marking interesting portions of text so
that they are more easily when viewed in the text format.

`----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------`
This is a comment and works great. You can end it with double-ticks, like this:
``

`----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------`
Or it could be entered by another comment command, like this:
`----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------`

So now we can use comments to just highlight headings in a content file, so that they
are easier to spot them in a content file:

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. 
Nam quam diam, hendrerit eu hendrerit quis, consequat quis erat.

`-----------------------------------`
`h1-` Introduction
